# C Examples

ANSI C examples from
[The C Programming Language - Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) 
by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, also known as K&R.

Examples adapted for use with [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection), developed and tested on an Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS.

Some examples provided to further clarify my own understanding of
how certain methods operate.
